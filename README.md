This project has been evolved from metahook and supports now latest Steam version of Counter-Strike.

Client SDK included. Compilation under Visual Studio 2022:

Compiling launcher:

    Unpack archive and open project file
    Select Release, Toolset Platform 143 and compile library

Compiling client library:

    Goto plugins/metaclient/ and open project file
    Select Release, Toolset Platform 143 and compile library

ATTENTION! Dunno't rename cstrike.exe to hl.exe (because by replacing hl.exe you will immediately receive VAC Ban)

Launch game directly from cstrike.exe (supports launch params also)

More tutorial for modding soon.
